1- the benefits of Next.js 
        1- server side rendering automatically
        2- SEO (search engine optimization) => SEO is crucial for optimizing a website's visibility and ranking in search engine results
                => increase organic traffic
                =. enhanced user experience
        3- Routing (next.js uses file-based routing system)
                => the routing is handled by the file system
                => use files for the routes 
                (app)
                    (blog) => https://localhost:3000/blog
                    (about) => https://localhost:3000/about
                    (profile) => https://localhost:3000/profile

        4- FullStack applications (API Routes)
            - enabling the creation of serverless functions to handle api requests
            - serverless APIs in Next.js are a way of creating API endpoints without the need for a traditional server 
                it allows us to build and deploy APIs:
                        - without managing server infrastructure
                        - worrying about scaling scaling their server as traffic increases
            - you can use this feature , by creating (API endpoints) using file (route.js)
                    (app)
                        (blog) => route.js
                        (about) => route.js
                        (profile) => route.js

        4- Automatic Code splitting :
                => code splitting is a technique that breaks down large bundles of javascript code into smaller,
                    more manageable chunks that can be loaded as needed
                => this reduces the initial load time of a website and optimizes the user's experience while browsing
                    - instead of using in react 
                            const About = lazy(()=> import('./About'))
                            const App = ()=> {
                                return(
                                    <Suspense fallback={<div> Loading ...</div>}
                                        <About/>
                                    </Suspense>
                                )
                            }
                => But in Next.js this process is entirely Automatic
                    it uses automatic code splitting by default to split pages into separate chunks

======================= Routing    ==================

2- page.js file which is responsible for starting page

    => filenames Matter!!
            next.js relies on reserved , special filenames
            But the filenames only matter inside the app folder

        => page.js => (localhost:3000/) Define page content, is the actual content, the starting page (localhost:3000/)
        => layout.js => Define wrapper around all app or  pages (around one or more pages)
        => not-found.js => Define "not Found" fallback page
        => error.js => Define "error" fallback page
        => loading.js => Fallback page which is shown whilst sibling or nested pages (or layouts) are fetching data
        => route.js => Allows you to create an API route (i.e., a page which does NOT return JSX code but instead data, e.g., in the JSON format)


3- you can navigate between pages using links
        - However, using regular anchor elements (<a>) for navigation can cause the browser to reload the entire page,
          which is not ideal for single-page applications.
        - To maintain the single-page application behavior, Next.js provides a special Link component from next/link that you should use instead of anchor elements. 
            This Link component ensures that navigation happens client-side, without a full page reload.
        - When using the Link component, the content of the next page is still pre-rendered on the server,
          but it is sent to the client and handled by client-side JavaScript code to update the UI, 

    => we can't use <a> tag because it will reload the page 
       we use Link from next/link instead
        ex:
            <a href="/about">About us</a>
            => import Link from 'next/link'
            <Link href="/about"> About us </Link>
         

4- globals.css: Contains CSS styles for the entire application.
    import globals.css in layout.js file
     It is imported into the layout.js file to make these styles available on every page.

5- icon.png: Special file name used as a favicon for the website.
    Adding an image called icon.png to the app folder automatically sets it as the favicon.

    app folder => icon.png => icon for in the browser's tab next to the website's name

6- components folder: Contains React components that are used across multiple pages.
    These components are not automatically treated as pages by Next.js and can be used to organize your UI.

    - To use these components: 
        you can import them into your pages and render them as you would with any other React component.
    - using the @ symbol  instead of (./) to refer to the root project folder in import paths
        example: 
                import component from './components/component'
            use @ instead ./
                import component from '@/components/component'

        example: 
            import Header from "@/components/header";
            export default function Home() {
                        return (
                            <main>
                            <Header />
                            </main>
                        )}

7- dynamic route
        Dynamic routes in Next.js provide a powerful way to create dynamic content based on the URL,
        making it easier to build dynamic and flexible websites.

       1- to make dynamic route :
            - blog folder:   (/blog it will render pag.js)
                    [slug] folder: (this is dynamic route and will render page.js in every dynamic route )
                            page.js 
                    page.js

        2-    in blog => page.js =>  (localhost:3000/blog)
                        <Link href="/blog/post-1">Post 1</Link>
                        <Link href="/blog/post-2">Post 2</Link>
            
        3-    it will render in blog => [slug] => page.js => (localhost:3000/blog/post-1), (localhost:3000/blog/post-2)

        4- you can access the dynamic route with 
            = by extract the {params} and then use the dynamic route folder name 
                like {params.slug}
                
                const BlogPostPage = ({ params }) => {
                            return (
                                <main>
                                <h1>BlogPostPage</h1>
                                <p>{params.slug}</p>
                                </main>
                            );
                            };

8- import images :
        import logoImg from "@/assets/logo.png";
        <img src={logoImg.src} alt="A plate" />

9- app folder => layout.js : 
        - It is responsible for rendering the main layout of the application, which includes the main header and the main content.
        - layout : is a function component

            import MainHeader from "@/components/main-header";
            import "./globals.css";


            export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
                        return (
                            <html lang="en">
                            <body>
                                <MainHeader />
                                {children}
                            </body>
                            </html>
                        );
                        }

          -  this is the main layout for all project 
          -  you can import all components to add them to the layout


10- using css modules with Next.js
    1- global css import it  in layout.js (app =>layout.js) file 

    2- css for components (main-header.js , main-header.module.css)
        main-header.js:
             => import classes from './main-header.module.css'
               <Link  className={classes.logo} href="/" />

11- working with images

            <img src={logoImg.src} alt="A plate with food on it" />
        
    => instead of using the img tag , we can use the <Image> from next/image tag :

            1-  imported from the "next/image" module  imported from the "next/image"
                that provides optimized image loading and rendering

                import Image from "next/image";

            2- <Image src={logoImg} alt="A plate" priority />
                The priority attribute: which tells Next.js to prioritize الاولويه ف التحميل the loading of this image.
                 This is useful for logos and other important images that should be displayed as soon as possible.
